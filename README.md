# Notes Management System - NotesLite
My FYP project featuring React-Native Framework along with Firebase integration.

# Purpose of Project
The purpose of this project is to create a digital note-taking solution that is specifically targeted at students to allow them to take notes in a very effective manner, as well as provide a platform for active learning.

# Objectives
  * To encourage students to make their own notes instead of copy and pasting which can lead to ineffective learning.
  * To encourage note sharing between students and lecturers.
  * To allow students and lecturers to collaborate in groups for the purpose of active learning which will promote consistency in notes.
  * To ensure that the solution contains no distrations for the student by only providing tools that are useful for learning.
  * To implement methods of note-taking that mimic a pen-paper approach.
